## How to Work with Branches

Branches allow team members to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

### Steps to Use Branches

1. **Check Out the Latest Main Branch**:
   - Ensure your local `main` branch is up-to-date:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```

2. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Use a meaningful name for your branch (e.g., `feature-login` or `bugfix-header`):
     ```bash
     git branch branch-name
     ```
   - Switch to the new branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout branch-name
     ```

3. **Work on the Branch**:
   - Make your changes and stage them:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit your changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Description of your changes"
     ```

4. **Push Your Branch to GitHub**:
   - Upload your branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin branch-name
     ```

5. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub.
   - Navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab.
   - Click **"New Pull Request"**.
   - Compare your branch with the `main` branch.
   - Submit the pull request for review.

6. **Merge the Branch**:
   - Once your pull request is approved, you or the repository owner can merge it into the `main` branch.
   - After merging, delete the branch to keep the repository clean:
     ```bash
     git branch -d branch-name
     git push origin --delete branch-name
     ```

## Best Practices for Collaboration

1. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use clear and descriptive commit messages to explain your changes.
   - Example: `Fixed navigation bar responsiveness on mobile devices`.

2. **Pull Often**:
   - Regularly pull updates from the `main` branch to avoid conflicts:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - If conflicts arise during merging, coordinate with your team to resolve them.

4. **Code Reviews**:
   - Request reviews for your pull requests and review others' work to maintain code quality.
